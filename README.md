# Armor Stand Arms datapack

**Automatically adds arms to armor stands**

---

If you want to **remove all arms** from **all armor stands** do

```
/trigger remove_all_arms
```
and to **enable** them again do

```
/trigger show_all_arms
```

---

If you want to **remove the arms** from **only one armor stand** do

```
/trigger remove_arms
```
and to **enable** them again do

```
/trigger show_arms
```

For that to work without complications: Go as near as you can to the armor stand and use /trigger
